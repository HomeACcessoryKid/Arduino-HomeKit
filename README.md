This is to gather those capable of making an Arduino library to create a HomeKit foundation

## There is an inititive to develop Arduino code at the Dutch hacker convention SHA-2017. See issue#2 for details!

#This does NOT contain any code or anything.

If this repository gains tracktion, it will live... for now, there is __working code__ for the ESP8266 in https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/ESP8266-HomeKit but it has not been converted to an [Arduino library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries) yet.
